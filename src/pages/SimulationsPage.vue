    <h3>Play with Power Up Simulations</h3>
    <p>
      Operate our simulations as a way to learn about nuclear power. This is
      where things get fun, and the experience becomes sticky. We want people
      checking on their power plants, tweaking parameters, attempting to create
      a disaster (which should trigger the safety mechanisms), and so on. It's
      all for fun and education.
