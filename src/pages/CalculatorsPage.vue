    <h3>Play with Power Up Calculators</h3>
    <p>
      Find out how much energy is produced by various types of power plants.
      Compare and contrast nuclear with other types. Or pit one type of nuclear
      against another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculators can give people a sense of how effective nuclear power is,
      especially compared with other energy sources. How much fissile material
      is needed to fulfill a lifetime of energy needs? How much waste is
      produced? And so on...
