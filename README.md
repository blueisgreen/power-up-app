## To Do

1. Better login session management: Use cookies to stay signed in
1. Give user visual indication that message was received - switch tabs or something
1. Write some good articles
1. Set up production instance
1. Use correct domain name - purchased powerupmagazine.com

## Bugs

1. Submitting an inquiry sends object for inquiry type instead of the value. That gets saved, which is wrong, too. Send the value, and on the backend do validation.
1. Want to pass screen name for responses. Or just hard-code 'Customer Support'
1. Need an easy way to see more articles from reader page.
1. Sign in button should allow in-place sign-in (not redirect to home).
1. Message banner at top either needs a way to send it messages or to go away in favor of self-clearing popup.
1. Notify user when inquiry sent and clear form properly (do not show validation errors).
